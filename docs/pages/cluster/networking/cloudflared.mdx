## Introduction

[`cloudflared`](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) is a client for tunneling traffic via a tunneling daemon into my homelab network, without requiring to poke holes into the firewall. In addition, it also provides SSL certificates for my applications.

## Prerequisites

As a pre-requisite it is first necessary to have a valid domain which is registered at cloudflare. My domain [amrap030.site](amrap030.site) is obtained from [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). The second thing that is necessary is the [cloudflared CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-local-tunnel/). To install `cloudflared` just run `brew install cloudflared`.

Once installed, you can use the `tunnel login` command from `cloudflared` to obtain a certificate.

```shell copy
cloudflared tunnel login
```

Next, create a new tunnel with the tunnel id, in my case `homelab`, by running the following. The resulting file with the necessary credentials can be found in `/Users/<username>/.cloudflared/<uuid>.json`.

```shell copy
cloudflared tunnel create homelab
```

Next, it is necessary to generate a tunnel credential file as a secret in the K3S cluster. For sensitive information, my cluster uses [SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops) in combination with [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) to encrypt secrets, before adding it to the repository, and decrypting secrets inside the cluster. The following example is the decrypted secret containing a JWT of the file content.

```yaml filename="secrets.sops.yaml" copy
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: tunnel-credentials
  namespace: cloudflared
data:
  credentials.json: eyJBY2N***yIn0=
type: Opaque
```

Lastly it is necessary to associate the tunnel with a DNS record.

```shell copy
cloudflared tunnel route dns homelab <subdomain>.<domain>
```

## Configuration

`cloudflared` is deployed via [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) and configured as follows.

### `deployment.yaml`

This file contains the deployment of `cloudflared` and specifies the configuration file directory via container startup arguments as `/etc/cloudflared/config/config.yaml`. In addition, the configuration file and the credentials of the tunnel are provided via volume mounts.

### `cloudflared-cm.yaml`

This `configmap` contains the ingress configuration for proxying traffic via cloudflare into my cluster. It always needs a `hostname`, a `service` which is the application to be reached in the form of `<protocol>://<servicename>.<namespace>:<port>` and `originRequest` to disable TLS verification.

```yaml filename="cloudflared-cm.yaml" copy
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cloudflared
  namespace: cloudflared
data:
  config.yaml: |
    tunnel: homelab
    credentials-file: /etc/cloudflared/creds/credentials.json
    metrics: 0.0.0.0:2000
    no-autoupdate: true
    ingress:
      - hostname: argocd.amrap030.site
        service: https://argocd-server.argocd
        originRequest:
          noTLSVerify: true
      - ...
      - service: http_status:404
```
