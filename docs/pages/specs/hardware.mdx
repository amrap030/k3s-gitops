## Hostnames

Every node has configured a hostname which follows a particular naming scheme:

```bash filename="/etc/hosts" copy
<service>.amrap030.site # external
<service>.amrap030.site # internal
```

## DNS

### Internal

All services with a UI running in my cluster have a dedicated subdomain configured. Those domains are managed by [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) which is configured as the main DNS server in my home network. It also performs network-wide ad blocking based on some block lists. [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) is installed on a [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/).

### External
