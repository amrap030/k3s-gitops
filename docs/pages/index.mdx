# Introduction

This is an ArgoCD based GitOps repository for my home lab infrastructure.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to deploy virtual machines on Proxmox VE
- [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) for managing the cluster as a GitOps operator
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) to easily execute scripts and commands
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) + [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for local repository management and docs only
- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) for provisioning and configuring the K3s cluster
- [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) to create golden ubuntu images for cluster nodes
- [SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops) as an editor for encrypted files
- [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) as a modern and secure file encryption tool
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) as the package manager for K3s
- [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) to customize K3s application configuration
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/de/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) as the cli tool for K3s

## Installation

1. Initially, to be able to provision a cluster, it is necessary to install the previously mentioned tools. This project uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) to easily execute scripts and commands. Accordingly, run the following commands to install the necessary tools.

```bash copy
task tools:install
```

2. After installing the tools, it is necessary to build a [golden image](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/tutorials/cloud-production/golden-image-with-hcp-packer) for each cluster node. We use [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) to create golden ubuntu images for cluster nodes. Run the following command to build a golden image with the latest ubuntu version and to upload it to your proxmox instance as a template.

```bash copy
task packer:build
```

> Prior to building the image, it is necessary to adjust some [variables](https://github.com/amrap030/k3s-gitops/blob/main/packer/credentials.pkr.hcl) according to your environment.

3. Now a golden image is available in your proxmox instance to be used. Accordingly, run the following commands to provision a specified amount of virtual machines as cluster nodes via [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

```bash copy
task terraform:init
task terraform:plan
task terraform:apply
```

> Prior to deploying the virtual machines, it is necessary to adjust the number of master and worker nodes and other [variables](https://github.com/amrap030/k3s-gitops/blob/main/terraform/credentials.auto.tfvars) according to your environment.

4. Finally, run the following command to install [K3s - Lightweight Kubernetes](https://docs.k3s.io/) on the cluster nodes.

```bash copy
task cluster:provision
```

> Prior to installing [K3s](https://docs.k3s.io/) on the cluster nodes, specify your master and worker nodes in the ansible [inventory](https://github.com/amrap030/k3s-ansible/blob/master/inventory/cluster/hosts.ini) file.

5. In the last step, we are bootstrapping [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) for managing the cluster as a GitOps operator. It automatically deploys every application specified in the repository into the cluster.

```bash copy
task cluster:bootstrap
```
